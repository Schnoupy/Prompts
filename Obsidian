> [!note]+ Summary
> **Napoleon Bonaparte** (1769-1821) was a **French military and political leader** who rose to prominence during the **French Revolution**. Born in **Corsica**, he became Emperor of the French in **1804** and established a large European empire. A skilled military commander, Napoleon's ambition and conquests led to the **Napoleonic Wars**, which lasted from **1803** to **1815**. Although initially successful, his empire eventually crumbled, and he was **exiled to the island of Elba** in **1814**. Napoleon escaped and returned to power briefly in **1815** before being defeated at the **Battle of Waterloo** and exiled again, this time to the remote island of **Saint Helena**, where he died in **1821**.
